            electronic music like "Faded," "Alone," and "Sing Me to Sleep," and his distinctive AW logo, blending genres
            like electro house, future bass, and progressive house to create melodic, high-energy tracks that built a
            global "Walker" community. He started making music in 2012 and rose to fame with "Faded" in 2015, becoming a
            major force in EDM with millions of streams and a strong online presence. </h4><br>
